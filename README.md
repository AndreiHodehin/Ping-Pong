# Ping-pong game

Ping-pong game for two players.

One player controls paddle by 'W'&'S' , another one by 'UP'&'DOWN'.

You can start play if dawnlod jar file from repository and run it.

It is possible to play alone. To do this, you need to open the project and in the Main class pass in the argument of the only method value "true".
The game is implemented so that over time the speed of the ball increases, but up to a certain limit. 
The ball also changes its direction slightly when touching any objects. This is done to diversify the game and each game can be easier or harder than the previous one.
